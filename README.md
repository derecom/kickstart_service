# Kickstart Service

If you don't have a full-fledged provisioning system, but you still want to
have some dynamic kickstart files served to your Anaconda installers, you can
use this kickstart service.

It is a OpenShift application capable of serving kickstarts made dynamic by the
use of ERB templates and request parameters.
